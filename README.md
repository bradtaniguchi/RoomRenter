**Branches**

We will use a basic 3 branch system. With most work being done in the
**Dev** branch. After a usable chunk of development is finished we will merge
the changes to the **Test** branch, which will be deployed to test.
If it passes the Test stage/branch, we will merge it(and any changes) to
the master/production branch.

**Master** - Current "production" branch, works as intended. If you are just
getting into the project, OR want to use the program AS-IS. Use this
branch. (We won't use releases or patches)

**Test** - Branch we will move to to test the functionality, and entire
system.

**Dev** - Branch most people will work on. Most pull/pushes will be to
this branch.
