[Todo List]
General program todos: (things to make the project more accessible)
1. Investigate how to use the package.json to run scripts (so we can run the start shell script?)
2. Add a windows launch command script
3. Possibly add an installer script for Linux and Windows (to install nodejs, and the necessary packages)
4. Limit the huge size of node_modules, by providing an installation script that installs the nwjs for you.
    This would limit or remove the need for the node_modules folder, as the user will downloading during installation.
    I will look into this solution...
